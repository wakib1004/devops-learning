#Level 1: The Basics
** Create a script that creates an Arena directory, adds warrior.txt, mage.txt, and archer.txt inside it, and lists the contents of the directory. **

```bash
#!/bin/bash

mkdir Arena
 cd Arena
 touch warrior.txt mage.txt archer.txt
 ls
```

#Level 2: Variables and Loops
** Create a script that outputs the numbers 1 to 10, one number per line. **

```bash 
#!/bin/bash

number=1

#Ouputs numbers 1 to 10 
while [ $number -lt 11 ]; do
  echo "$number"
  ((number++))
done
```

#3: Conditional Statements
** Write a script that checks if a file named hero.txt exists in the Arena
directory. If it does, print "Hero found!"; otherwise, print "Hero missing!". **

```bash 
#!/bin/bash

if [ -f Arena/hero.txt ]; then
  echo "Hero found!"
else
  echo "Hero missing!"
fi
```

#Level 4: File Manipulation
**Create a script that copies all .txt files from the Arena directory to a new directory called Backup.**

```bash
#!/bin/bash

mkdir -p ~/Backup
cp ~/Arena/*.txt ~/Backup
```

#Level 5: 
** :' Script that: 

1. Creates "Battlefield" directory and 3 files within it: knight.txt, sorcerer.txt, rogue.txt.
2. Checks if **knight.txt** exists inside **Battlefield**.
   * If it exists, creates a folder called **Archive** and moves `knight.txt` into it.
3. Displays the contents of both "Battlefield" and "Archive" directories.
  
This combines directory creation, file creation, conditional checking, moving files, and listing contents — all in one workflow.
 '

 ```bash 
#!/bin/bash

mkdir Battlefield
cd Battlefield
touch knight.txt sorcerer.txt rogue.txt

if [ -f Battlefield/knight.txt ]; then
  mkdir Archive
  mv knight.txt Archive/knight.txt
fi

echo "Contents of Battlefield:"
ls Battlefield 
echo "Content of Archive:"
ls Archive
 ```


 #Level 6: Argument Parsing
 :' Write a script that accepts a filename as an argument and prints the number
 of lines in that file. If no filename is provided, display a message saying 'No file provided'.
 '

 ```bash
 
#!/bin/bash

#Checks if any arguments were provided
if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then
 echo "No filename provided"
    exit 1
fi

filename= $1
number=0

if [ -f $filename ]; then
  while IFS= read -r line; do
    ((number++))
  done < $filename
  echo "The number of lines in the file is: $number"
else
  echo "File not found"
fi

 ```

#Level 7: File Sorting Script
Script that sorts all .txt files in a directory by their size, from smallest to largest, 
and displays the sorted list.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
directory=$1
ls -Srl $directory/*.txt | awk '{print $5, $9}'

:' This is used by passing in "directory_name"
./script_name.sh "directory_name"
'

```

#Level 8: Multi-File Searcher
Searches for a specific word or phrase across all .log files in a directory and outputs
the names of the files that contain the word or phrase.

```bash

#!/bin/bash

directory="Arena"
word_or_phrase="line"

#Exits if directory "Arena" does not exist.
if [ ! -d "$directory" ]; then
  echo "$directory does not exist."
  exit 1
fi

grep -l "$word_or_phrase" $directory/*.log
exit_code=$?

if [ $exit_code -ge 1 ]; then
 echo "The word/phrase $word_or_phrase does not exist in any .log files in this directory"
fi

```
