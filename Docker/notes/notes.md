# Docker Notes

## Table of contents 


## Containers
A container is a unit of deployment that includes everything needed to run an application, such as the compiled code, runtime, system libraries and system tools.

**Why use Containers**

1. Move faster by deplying small units.
2. Use fewer resources
3. Fit more on the same host
4. Faster automation
5. Portability
6. Isolation (If one fails, it will not take the whole system down with it)


**Virtual Machines**
A virtual machine (VM) is a software-based computer that runs inside a real computer, with its own operating system and apps.

## VMs vs Containers

### Comparasion Table

| Virtual Machine | Container
| :--- | :--- |
| Large footprint | Lightweight |
| Slow to boot | Quick to start (No booting needed | 
| Ideal for long running tasks | Ideal for short lived tasks | 
|  | Portable (can run same way everywhere) | 

## Container Registry

## Definitions 

Runtime - what exceutes the program after it has been written.

System libraries - Ready‑made chunks of code your program can call to do specific tasks.

System tools - Software programs included with or provided for an operating system that help manage, maintain, configure a computer system.



## Container Image 

Container images are read-only templates a container runtime uses to create a running container, it holds everything needed to run an application.
