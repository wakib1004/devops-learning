# TCP/IP Model

The TCP/IP model is a 4 layered framework that describes how data is transmitted over 
a network, especially the Internet, using the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the Internet Protocol (IP).

It is the practical model used in real networks and the Internet.

### **🧱 Layers of TCP/IP Model (Top → Bottom)**

1. Application Layer

2. Transport Layer

3. Internet Layer

4. Network Access Layer

**Application Layer**

- Provides network services to user applications.
- Absorbs the role of Application, presentation and session layer in OSI mode. Check here: 

Protocols: HTTP, TLS, DNS

**Transport Layer**

- Responsible for end to end communcation using ports.
- Provide different data transfer services depending upon which protocol is chosen.
  
Protocols: TCP and UDP.

**🌐 Internet Layer**

- Deals with routing (choosing the best path for data to travel) data accross different networks.
- Responsible for moving data from one network to the destination network using IP addresses.

Protocol: IP

**Network Acess Layer**

-Condensed format of Layer 1 and Layer 2 of the OSI model. Check them here:
